"""To determine the level of APTES protonation, locating the water's
surface is necessary. This requires inputting all nanoparticle data
(COR and APT) for accurate placement. As the unwrap structure cannot
be used, the script identifies the location of each water molecule
based on the location of the O atom in the water molecules."""
