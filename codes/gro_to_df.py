"""reading GRO files:
Lines contain the following information (top to bottom):

        title string (free format string, optional time in ps after
        't=')
        number of atoms (free format integer)
        one line for each atom (fixed format, see below)
        box vectors (free format, space separated reals), values:
        v1(x) v2(y) v3(z) v1(y) v1(z) v2(x) v2(z) v3(x) v3(y),
        the last 6 values may be omitted (they will be set to zero).
        GROMACS only supports boxes with v1(y)=v1(z)=v2(z)=0.

This format is fixed, ie. all columns are in a fixed position.
Optionally (for now only yet with trjconv) you can write gro files
with any number of decimal places, the format will then be n+5
positions with n decimal places (n+1 for velocities) in stead of 8
with 3 (with 4 for velocities). Upon reading, the precision will be
inferred from the distance between the decimal points (which will be
n+5). Columns contain the following information (from left to right):

        residue number (5 positions, integer)
        residue name (5 characters)
        atom name (5 characters)
        atom number (5 positions, integer)
        position (in nm, x y z in 3 columns, each 8 positions with 3
        decimal places)
        velocity (in nm/ps (or km/s), x y z in 3 columns, each 8
        positions with 4 decimal places)

Note that separate molecules or ions (e.g. water or Cl-) are regarded
as residues. If you want to write such a file in your own program
without using the GROMACS libraries you can use the following formats:

C format
    "%5d%-5s%5s%5d%8.3f%8.3f%8.3f%8.4f%8.4f%8.4f"
Fortran format
    (i5,2a5,i5,3f8.3,3f8.4)
Pascal format
    This is left as an exercise for the user

Note that this is the format for writing, as in the above example
fields may be written without spaces, and therefore can not be read
with the same format statement in C.
GROMACS manual
based on the C or fortran format length of the data line is 68. but
python read it as 69!!!
Columns 1-5: Atom serial number.
Columns 6-10: Atom name or type.
Columns 11-15: Residue name.
Columns 16-20: Residue number.
Columns 21-28: Atom coordinates along the x-axis (in nanometers).
Columns 29-36: Atom coordinates along the y-axis (in nanometers).
Columns 37-44: Atom coordinates along the z-axis (in nanometers).
Columns 45-48: Atom velocity (optional; not always present in GRO files).
Note: The coordinates and velocities are typically given in nanometers
