"""This script utilizes get_data.py to obtain a list and data for the
APTES chain that requires protonation. The script then identifies
suitable positions for each additional hydrogen atom near the N atom,
ensuring it does not interfere with other atoms in the surrounding
residues. Initially, the script locates a plausible area for the
hydrogen atom and subsequently checks for the presence of other atoms.
Finally, the script places the hydrogen atom in a suitable position.
