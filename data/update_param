All the distance values are in angestrom and angles in degree
############### CONSTANT VALUES ##############
The contact angle of the nanoparticle (NP)
@ANGLE=90
Estimate radius of the NP before functionalization with APTES
@RADIUS=25
Name of the NP itp files, write them in list of list. The names of the APTES chain and CORE
should follow the the name of the files. First the name of APTES than the name of the COR
And seperate them with semicolon, like [file1, APT, COR]; [file2, APU, COS]
@NP_ITP=[APT_COR, APT, COR]; [APU_COS, APU, COS]
Topology file
@TOPOFILE=topol.top
############### INTERACTIVE VALUES ###########
intereface location -> caculated by analysing script
If READ then read it from the READ file, otherwise from the fixed value set in here
@READ=True
@FILE=GRO
If no READ the interface is got from here: (They should set anyway)
@INTERFACE=12.81
interface thickness
@INTERFACE_WIDTH=10.47
How to select atoms, under intereface: INTERFACE
under upper bound of the interface: UPPERBOUND
under lower bound of the interface: LOWERBOUND
within the interface: WHITIN
@LINE=UPPERBOUND
the center of mass of the nanoparticle
@NP_ZLOC=10
the number of the maximum APTES to protonate -> Optional
@NUMAPTES=10
@BETTER_POS=100
############### Computation parameters ###########
Number of points to make to try to put H of new protonation there, around 100
@NUMSAMPLE=100
Distance to put between ION and other atoms
@ION_DISTANCE=1
Number of times try to find a place for an ion, around 1000
@ION_ATTEPTS=1000
####################### DEBUG ###################
If True (any word will means True!) many data files will be written, with extension "debug"
@DEBUG=True
